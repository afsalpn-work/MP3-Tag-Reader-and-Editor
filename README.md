# MP3-Tag-Reader-and-Editor
Project to read the mp3 file tag and to edit it if required
Developed a command line argument driven application that reads and displays metadata from MP3 files by parsing ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. The tool extracts information such as song title, artist, album, track number, year, genre, and comments, while also supporting embedded cover art in ID3v2. It was implemented using file handling and binary parsing in C, with careful handling of different encodings and tag versions to ensure accurate extraction.
